 parameter alpha =    1.250
 ydot_i = -alpha*i * y_i (i = 1,...,NEQ)
 RTOL, ATOL =    0.1E-04   0.1E-09
 Method is ERK
 Number of processors =   4

Max. absolute error is   0.22E-08


Final statistics:

 number of steps =    97
 number of step attempts =    97
 number of fe evals. =   585
 number of fi evals. =     0
 number of nonlinear iters. =     0
 number of nonlinear conv. failures =   0
 number of error test failures =   0
