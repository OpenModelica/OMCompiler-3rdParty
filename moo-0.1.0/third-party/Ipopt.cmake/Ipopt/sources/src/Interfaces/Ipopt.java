/** A Java Native Interface for the Ipopt optimization solver.
 *
 * Ipopt is a solver for large scale nonlinear optimization problems (NLP).
 *
 * The Java Native Interface (JNI) is a programming framework that allows
 * Java code running in the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to call and be
 * called by native applications (programs specific to a hardware and
 * operating system platform) and libraries written in other languages,
 * such as C and C++.
 *
 * This class is a JNI hook around the C++ interface of Ipopt, as a consequence
 * it will need a nativelly compiled DLL to run.
 * For more details about Ipopt [click here](https://github.com/coin-or/Ipopt).
 *
 * The user should subclass this class and implement the abstract methods.
 * At some point before solving the problem the
 * {@link #create(int, int, int, int, int)}
 * function should be called.
 * For simple cases you can call this function in the constructor of your class.
 *
 * Once the problem was created, {@link #OptimizeNLP()} will solve the problem.
 * Objects of this class can be reused to solve different problems, in other words,
 * {@link #create(int, int, int, int, int)}
 * and {@link #OptimizeNLP()} can be called multiple times.
 *
 * Programmers must call {@link #dispose()} when finished using a
 * Ipopt object, otherwise the nativelly allocated memory will be disposed of only
 * when the JVM call {@link #finalize()} on it.
