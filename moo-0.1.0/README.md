# **MOO: Modelica / Model Optimizer - A Generic Framework for Dynamic Optimization**

This is **MOO: Modelica / Model Optimizer v.0.1.0**, a flexible and extensible framework for solving optimization problems.
**MOO** provides a generic Nonlinear Programming (NLP) layer with built-in scaling support and a generic NLP solver interface. While primarily designed for dynamic optimization in the Modelica ecosystem (General Dynamic Optimization Problems - GDOPs, training of Physics-enhanced Neural ODEs - PeN-ODEs), it is equally applicable to other domains, e.g. model predictive control (MPC).
